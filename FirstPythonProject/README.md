### Project Overview

 This Python project is focussed on determining the highest scorer in a particular subject given a set of students along with their marks.


### Learnings from the project

 This was my first piece of code that I have written in Python using operators, string functions,lists and dictionaries. It gave me an insight into using Python to perform basic real world problems.
